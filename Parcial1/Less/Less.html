        Starbucks created Tribute Blend® to celebrate the company’s 40th anniversary,
        to honor customers and partners, and to recognize the accomplishments of the coffee producers
        and roasters.
    </p>
    <p class="parrafo">
        Tribute Blend® combines four of customers’ all-time favorite coffees from all three growing regions.
        The Sun-Dried Ethiopia coffee, with an exotic flourish of dark cherry, is from Africa. Aged Sumatra
        comes from the Asia/Pacific region, featuring deep notes of cedar and sweet. Also originating from
        the Asia/Pacific area is the Papua New Guinea coffee, a deep-toned coffee with juicy herbal taste.
        Colombia coffee, with balanced and nutty tasting notes, hails from Latin America.

        Starbucks does a pretty bad job at describing their coffees. Most of the time that's ok, because their
        coffees
        aren't always that interesting. Then there's a coffee that you enjoy, and they write the following:
        Tasting Notes: Spicy and full-bodied with berry and dark cherry notes
